- self-introduction
- 10 minutes to present your solution



## The language: Go

- statically typed
- compiled
- garbage-collected
- object-oriented
- designed with concurrency in mind (goroutines, channels)

Note:
- statically typed, dynamic type dispatching possible
- What you get out of the compiler is a statically linked binary that run on the
  target plattform without any additional libraries



## The language: Goroutines

<!--
```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
  "runtime"
)

func f(from string) {
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(from, ":", i)
        time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func main() {
    runtime.GOMAXPROCS(2) // schedule on 2 OS-Threads

    go f("goroutine")
    f("direct")

    time.Sleep(1000 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Println("finish")
}
```
-->


Note:
- ordinary function f: prints string with incrementing number 3 times a row,
  sleep after each print
- green-thread scheduled by the runtime on a number of os-threads
- advantage:

- Nice features of the language if it is rather exotic (i.e., not C/C++, Java, Python, C#).
- Implementation details of parallel programming model. E.g., if you use C
Pthreads, you could show a toy example of creating and joining threads.



## The language: Channels



## Current Status

Note:
- Your current status: which programs you already implemented.



## Graph

Note:
- Your current status: which programs you already implemented.



## Optimizations

Note:
- A small example of one of the programs to get look&feel of the language/programming model.
- Tricks and optimizations, if any.
